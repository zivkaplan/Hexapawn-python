# Hexapawn-python

### play a game of Hexapwan against the computer, but beware, it learns! 

A little AI project I made for by the game Hexapawn as described in this [youtube video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sw7UAZNgGg8&t=295s&ab_channel=Vsauce20)

The computer starts with all its possible moves, and deletes it's uneffective ones in case of a loss.
thus, making it a better opponet with each game.
